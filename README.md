# Script to recommend B3 stocks, ETFs and BDRs

## (Currently based only on graph analysis)

- The script is based on donchian channels (basically support and resistance analysis)
- The grading system currently goes from (Not enough data but maybe) 1 to 4 (4 Being the ideal time to buy it)
- The interpreter version tested is **Python 3.8.5**
- Dependencies are listed on requirements.txt

Thanks! Pedro Ganme!
